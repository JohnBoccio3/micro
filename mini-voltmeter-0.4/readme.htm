Software for "3 digit LED display, mini DVM module".

Copyright: GPL V2

Hardware description: see subdirectory hw and
http://www.tuxgraphics.org/electronics/200706/mini-digital-voltmeter.shtml
or 
http://www.tuxgraphics.org/electronics/200903/three-digit-display.shtml

The software is written for AVR GCC and atmega8.

Configuration
-------------
Edit the file analog.c and change the VDIV at the beginning
of the file. This is the voltage divider factor (resistors
Rx and Ry). There is a Javascript calculator at the end
of http://www.tuxgraphics.org/electronics/200706/mini-digital-voltmeter.shtml
to calculate VDIV.

If you add an amplifer circuit then you can also measure smaller
signals than 2.56V.

Edit the file main.c and change DP_DIG according to your decimal
point settings. This just defines if leading zeros are stripped or
not. The real decimal point setting is done via jumpers on the board.

For the counter edit file counter.c 

Compile:
--------
A Makefile is included.

To compile use the command:
make 

Change the fuse bytes to 8MHz internal clock:
make fuse 

 or run the command:
   avrdude -p m8 -c avrusb500 -u -v -U lfuse:w:0xe4:m

The fuses are then set as follows:
 lfuse reads as E4
 hfuse reads as D9

Finally load the file main.hex into the microcontroller:
make load

The above command loads the DVM (voltmeter) software.

The command
make load_counter

Would load the counter software.

History:
version 0.1: 2007-06-18, first Version
version 0.2: 2008-09-10, small correction by RWCooper divide voltage
                         by 10 if one digit behind decimal point is used.
                         Sorry for the long time it took to update this :-(.
version 0.3: 2009-01-13, Average results over two periods
                         Clean-up Makefile
version 0.4: 2009-03-02, Update display faster in case of big changes in value
                         Added counter software.
